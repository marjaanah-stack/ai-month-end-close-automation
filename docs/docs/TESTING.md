# Testing Guide

This guide walks you through testing all 4 routes of the Month-End Close Orchestrator to ensure everything works correctly.

---

## Pre-Test Checklist

Before testing, ensure:

- ‚úÖ All Make.com connections are active (green checkmarks)
- ‚úÖ Airtable has 15 sample tasks (T001-T015)
- ‚úÖ Google Sheet has bank transaction data
- ‚úÖ Slack channel `#month-end-close` exists
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API key is valid and has credits

**Estimated testing time:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Test Strategy

We'll test each route independently, then run a complete end-to-end test.
```
Test Order:
1. Route 1 (Daily Report) - Quickest to verify
2. Route 3 (Bank Rec) - Tests Google Sheets integration
3. Route 2 (Email Parser) - Tests Gmail + AI extraction
4. Route 4 (Final Report) - Tests completion workflow
5. End-to-End - Full close cycle simulation
```

---

## Route 1: Daily Progress Report

### Objective
Verify that the scenario generates and posts AI-powered daily summaries.

### Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Verify T001 exists in Airtable:**
   - Open your Airtable base
   - Confirm Task T001 is present (any status is fine)

2. **Clear Slack channel:**
   - Go to `#month-end-close`
   - Note the last message timestamp (for comparison)

### Test Steps

**Step 1:** Run the scenario
```
Make.com ‚Üí Click "Run once" button
```

**Step 2:** Monitor execution
- Watch modules turn green as they execute
- Route 1 modules should all complete successfully
- Routes 2-4 may stop at filters (this is correct!)

**Step 3:** Verify Slack output

Expected message format:
```
üìä **DAILY CLOSE PROGRESS REPORT**
Date: [Current date]

**Overview:**
‚úÖ Completed: X/15 (XX%)
üîÑ In Progress: X
‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started: X
üö´ Blocked: X
‚è∞ Overdue: X

**Executive Summary:**

## Route 2: Email Response Parser

### Objective
Verify AI extracts task information from emails and updates Airtable.

### Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Reset test task:**
   - In Airtable, set T001 back to "Not Started"
   - Clear any Completion Note
   - Set Actual Hours to blank

2. **Mark all emails as read:**
   - Go to Gmail
   - Select all unread emails related to testing
   - Mark as read (so we start fresh)

3. **Prepare test email (don't send yet):**
```
   To: [your-email]@gmail.com
   Subject: Task T001 completed
   Body: Hi, I've finished task T001. The AP system is now locked and no new entries will be accepted.
```

### Test Steps

**Step 1:** Send test email
- Send the prepared email to yourself
- **Important:** Do NOT open/read it

**Step 2:** Wait 30 seconds
- Gmail needs time to index the email
- Make.com checks for unread emails

**Step 3:** Run the scenario
```
Make.com ‚Üí Click "Run once"
```

**Step 4:** Monitor Route 2 execution
- Gmail module (16) should find 1 email
- OpenAI module (17) should extract "T001"
- Airtable modules (18-19) should update T001

**Step 5:** Verify Airtable update

Check T001:
- Status should change to "Completed"
- Completion Note should mention email update
- Record should show timestamp update

**Step 6:** Verify Slack notification

Expected message format:
```
‚úÖ **Task Updated via Email**

Task: T001 - Lock AP System - Prevent New Entries
Previous Status: Not Started
New Status: Completed

Updated based on email from: [Your Name]

AI Analysis: T001
```

**Step 7:** Verify email marked as read
- Check Gmail - test email should now be marked as read

### Pass/Fail Criteria

‚úÖ **PASS if:**
- Gmail module finds the email
- AI correctly extracts "T001"
- T001 status updates to "Completed"
- Slack notification appears
- Email marked as read

‚ùå **FAIL if:**
- Gmail module finds 0 emails (filter blocked it)
- AI extracts wrong task ID or "NONE"
- T001 doesn't update
- Slack shows wrong task information

### Troubleshooting

**Issue:** "Gmail found no emails"
- Check: Is email still unread?
- Check: Gmail query in module 16 correct?
- Fix: Change query to just `newer_than:1h` (broader search)

**Issue:** "AI extracted NONE or wrong ID"
- Check: Does email body mention "T001"?
- Check: OpenAI prompt in module 17
- Fix: Improve email wording to be more explicit

**Issue:** "Wrong task updated (not T001)"
- Known issue: Airtable Search (18) is hardcoded to T002
- Fix: Change formula to `{Task ID}="T001"` for this test

**Issue:** "Multiple Slack messages (spam)"
- Known limitation: Aggregation not implemented
- Impact: Cosmetic only, all functional
- Fix: See [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#known-issues)
